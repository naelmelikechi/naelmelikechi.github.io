        <h2>Nael Melikechi</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the creative work I've done. There are a few music videos, some vlogs, and 3D work I've created for 23:59.<br>
            23:59 is a collective of creative individuals, including my childhood friends, where some of us focus on music videos, filmmaking, as well as music and modeling.

        <br>
        My goal in life is to find a job where I can blend both of my passions, filmmaking and computer science.
        <br>
        You can find some of my coding projects on my github page, but most of the conding projects I've done were for school and not available online.
